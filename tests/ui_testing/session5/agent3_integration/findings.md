## Key Findings

### ✅ Complete User Journey
The integration test successfully verified:
- User registration and automatic login
- Conversation creation
- Message send/receive cycle
- Settings panel functionality
- Theme switching
- Model selection display

### ✅ Theme System
- 4 themes available
- Midnight theme applied correctly
- Theme persists across interactions

### ✅ Model System
Available models displayed correctly:
- qwen2.5-coder:3b (tools)
- gurubot/self-after-dark:latest (tools)
- ministral-3:latest (tools, vision)
- qwen3-vl:8b (tools, vision, think)
- deepseek-coder-v2:latest

### ⚠️ Test Timeout (NOT a UI Bug)
Section A9 timed out because:
- AI was generating response (84 seconds elapsed)
- Send button correctly disabled during generation
- Test tried to send before AI finished

**Verdict:** Test timing issue, not a UI bug. The UI correctly prevents sending during AI generation.
